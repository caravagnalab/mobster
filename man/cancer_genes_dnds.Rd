\description{
List of gene ids (HuGO format) to compute dnds values.
There are 2 lists available of putative driver genes, and 2 lists of
essential genes; these lists have been subset to include only
genes in the RefCDS database.

Drivers have been compiled in
`Martincorena, et al. Cell 171.5 (2017): 1029-1041`, and in
`Tarabichi, et al. Nature Genetics 50.12 (2018): 1630`.
Essential genes have been compiled using two different cell lines in
`Wang et al. Science 350.6264 (2015): 1096-1101.` and
`Bloomen et al. Science 350.6264 (2015): 1092-1096`. All lists are
available and named accordingly; use `names(cancer_genes_dnds)` to
see the available names.
