\title{Filter MOBSTER output clusters.}
\usage{
choose_clusters(
  x,
  pi_cutoff = 0.02,
  N_cutoff = 10,
  Beta_variance_cutoff = 1e-04,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A MOBSTER fit object.}

\item{pi_cutoff}{The cutoff on the mixing proportions, default is 0.02.}

\item{N_cutoff}{The cutoff on the number of mutations assigned to a cluster, default is 10.}

\item{Beta_variance_cutoff}{Minimum variance for a Beta peak.}

\item{verbose}{If outputs should be reported to screen or not, default is no.}
}
\value{
A MOBSTER fit object where clusters are larger than \code{pi_cutoff} and contain
at least \code{N_cutoff}. If no such cluster exists an error is generated.
}
\description{
This function can filter out the clusters computed by MOBSTER
based on two criteria: the mixing proportion value,  the number of mutations
assigned and the variance of the Beta clusters.

For all criteria a scalar should be given as input. The return object
will contain only the clusters that pass all filters. If any cluster is dropped
the latent variables are re-computed, as well as the clustering assignments and the
mixing proportions (all mutations will be still assigned after clusters' removal).
}
\examples{
data('fit_example', package = 'mobster')

# Does not change anything (no filter triggered)
choose_clusters(fit_example$best)

# Remove one Beta component because it has less than 100 points (renders the fit very poor)
choose_clusters(fit_example$best, N_cutoff = 100)
}
