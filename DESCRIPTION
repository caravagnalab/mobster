Description: MOBSTER is a package that implements a statistical model for tumour subclonal deconvolution
    which combines Dirichlet mixtures with distributions predicted by theoretical population genetics. The
    model implemented is a parametric (finite) mixture with multiple Beta components, and one Pareto power 
    law tail. Beta components capture mutations that rise up in frequency by positive selection, and the 
    Pareto tail models alleles resulting from neutral, intra-clone, evolutionary dynamics. MOBSTER is part of the
    evoverse, a package that gathers multiple R packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
